<h1>Contribution guidelines</h1>
<h2>Ways to contribute</h2>
You can make GreyCloud better by:<br />
<ul>
  <li>Reporting bugs over GitHub issues or e-mail</li>
  <li>Sending improvemets over GitHub issues or e-mail</li>
  <li>Writing documentation</li>
  <li>Commiting changes to the repository</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bug report guidelines<br /></h2>
If you want to report a bug over
GitHub issues, you have to create a GitHub account. If you want to use
e-mail for reporting an error, use "GreyCloud bug report" as subject.
Use the
following scheme for the heading:<br />
My problem (BUG vX.X.X)<br />
Replace "My problem" with a short description of your problem and
"X.X.X" with the version where you found the bug. Describe the problem
exactly, when it appears and in which environment.<br />
<h2>Feature request guidelines</h2>
If you have ideas for new features or
improvements, you can write an e-mail or GitHub issue, too. Use
"GreyCloud enhancement" as subject to mark your text as an improvement
and describe what would make
GreyCloud better.<br />
<h2>Development guidelines</h2>
To create changes in
GreyCloud, you can clone the current development repository in the
"development" branch. Before you start to develop, it is important to
say the community what changes you want to make. This helps to maintain
the work all developers do and allows to write code without conflicts.
Use GitHub issues for discussions. If your work is ready, commit your
changes into the "experimental" branch.<br />
Rules:<br />
<ul>
  <li>Try to write clear code.<br /></li>
  <li>Document your code so that others can see how it works.</li>
  <li>Don't change any code without discussing it in GitHub issues!</li>
  <li>Don't change any copyright! All changes you make will stay under
the Copyright
© 2018 Rotert Software. Note that if you submit changes to the
repository, you
grant Rotert Software non-exclusive, royality-free permissions to
change, copy, distribute, share and sell your work
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">WITHOUT ANY LIMITATIONS</span>!</li>
  <li>It is recommended to include your GitHub username into your
commits so others can see that the commit are yours with one look.<br />
  </li>
  <li>Only commit to the "experimental" branch!</li>
  <li>Only use third party libraries and code if they are compatible with the license used in the project or if you and Rotert Software have a right to use them!<br /></li>
  <li>It is also recommended to read the following guide: <a href="http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2010/Dec-31.html">

  	</a><br />
  </li>
</ul>
After you finished your work, create a pull request to merge the
changes into the "development" branch. Describe exactly what you
changed. Note that maybe not all changes will be merged into the source.<br /><br />
