It executes a SQL query from the sql_query argument sended over POST or GET. The API returns a list mapped into the GreyCloud Service XML Format.

You need professional administration skills for configuring Apache and GreyCloud. If the configurations are not correct, this might cause into security issues. This tutorial gives only a basic overview of the hosting process and has no claim to completeness and correctness! Virtual Python environment It is recommended to host GreyCloud in a virtual Python environement. To create virtual Python enviroments, you first need to install the 'virtualenv' package by running pip install virtualenv . After that, you can create a new environment with virtualenv GreyCloudEnv . Activate the Python interpreter with source GreyCloudEnv/bin/activate and install Django and PyMySQL by running pip install django=2.0 pymysql . Cofigure Apache To host GreyCloud on the Apache web server, you have to install mod_wsgi. On Debian based systems like Ubuntu, you can install mod_wsgi with sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-wsgi-py3 . After that, you have to enable mod_wsgi by running sudo a2enmod wsgi in your terminal. Create a new <site>.conf file in /etc/apache2/sites-available with the following content (replace '...' with other settings): <VirtualHost myhost.com:8080> ... Alias /static /var/www/html/GreyCloud/app_data/static <Directory /var/www/html/GreyCloud/app_data/static> Require all granted </Directory> <Directory /var/www/html/GreyCloud/GreyCloud> <Files wsgi.py> Require all granted </Files> </Directory> WSGIDaemonProcess GreyCloud python-home=/path/to/GreyCloudEnv WSGIProcessGroup GreyCloud WSGIScriptAlias / /var/www/html/GreyCloud/GreyCloud/wsgi.py </VirtualHost> If you want to use GreyCloud on an other port than 80, you have to add Listen <your port number> to /etc/apache2/ports.conf . Enable your vittual host file by running sudo a2ensite <site>.conf in a terminal. Configure GreyCloud Download the GreyCloud server .zip or .tar file and unpack the archive into your Apache server root (normally /var/www/html ). Rename the GreyCloud server folder into \"GreyCloud\". Open GreyCloud/app_data/conf/usersettings.conf in a text editor. Set DEBUG to false, PYTHON_VERSION to your Python virtual environment version, VENV_ROOT to your virtual environment path. Read more about GreyCloud settings here . Set up database Set up your database with sudo python launcher.py install . Change permissions To give Apache access to the files, change the group of GreyCloud to www-data and grant it read-only permission. After that, grant www-data read and write permissions for GreyCloud/app_data .","title":"Hosting"},{"location":"hosting.html#greycloud-documentation-hosting","text":"Warning!

To install Django, you need Python >= 3.4. You can download Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/ . Install Django 2.0 by running pip install django==2.0 in a terminal. To use MySQL, you also have to install PyMySQL with pip install pymysql . Set up database If you didn't install GreyCloud yet, run python launcher.py install . This will: generate a secret key in app_data/conf/secret_key.keyfile generate a SQLite database app_data/db/db.djdb collect all static files in the folders migrate all models to the database generate the website create a new superuser If you want to use another database database system, read the 'GreyCloud settings' page.

Now you are able to open the GreyCloud homepage in a web browser with the URL localhost:8000 . Warning! The built-in server is only for development! For a productive server, you can host GreyCloud on Linux with the Apache web server. Dashboard You can administrate all your services from the GreyCloud dashboard. To open the Dashboard, you can click on the link \"GreyCloud administration\". Creating web services with Python To create web services for GreyCloud, you first have to write a python script like this: @public_modifier def f(ignore): import math sinus = math.sin(20) testmodule = import_module(\"test\", \"/home/scripts/test.py\") return (\"Hallo\", sinus, testmodule.returner(None)) To make a function available for the GreyCloud web service API, you need to decorate it with public_modifier . Note that the import statement has to be placed in the function to make this code snippet work. To import a script from the GreyCloud filesystem, you can use import_module . This function has an imaginary module name as first parameter and the path to the script as a second parameter. Imported scripts behave like normal Python scripts.
