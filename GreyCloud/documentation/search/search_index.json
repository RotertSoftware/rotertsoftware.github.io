You need professional administration skills for configuring Apache and GreyCloud. If the configurations are not correct, this might cause into security issues. This tutorial gives only a basic overview of the hosting process and has no claim to completeness and correctness! Virtual Python environment It is recommended to host GreyCloud in a virtual Python environement. To create virtual Python enviroments, you first need to install the 'virtualenv' package by running pip install virtualenv . After that, you can create a new environment with virtualenv GreyCloudEnv . Activate the Python interpreter with source GreyCloudEnv/bin/activate and install Django and mysqlclient by running pip install django=2.0 mysqlclient . Cofigure Apache To host GreyCloud on the Apache web server, you have to install mod_wsgi. On Debian based systems like Ubuntu, you can install mod_wsgi with sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-wsgi-py3 . After that, you have to enable mod_wsgi by running sudo a2enmod wsgi in your terminal. Create a new <site>.conf file in /etc/apache2/sites-available with the following content (replace '...' with other settings): <VirtualHost myhost.com:8080> ...

Enable your vittual host file by running sudo a2ensite <site>.conf in a terminal. Configure GreyCloud Download the GreyCloud server .zip or .tar file and unpack the archive into your Apache server root (normally /var/www/html ). Rename the GreyCloud server folder into \"GreyCloud\". Open GreyCloud/app_data/conf/usersettings.conf in a text editor. Set DEBUG to false, PYTHON_VERSION to your Python virtual environment version, VENV_ROOT to your virtual environment path. Read more about GreyCloud settings here . Set up database Set up your database with sudo python launcher.py install . Change permissions To give Apache access to the files, change the group of GreyCloud to www-data and grant it read-only permission. After that, grant www-data read and write permissions for GreyCloud/app_data .","title":"Hosting"},{"location":"hosting/#greycloud-documentation-hosting","text":"Warning!
